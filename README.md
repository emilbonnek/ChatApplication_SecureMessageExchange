# Chat Application - Secure Message Exchange
This is an assignment for the course Applied Cryptography (02232) at Technical University of Denmark.

In this project we were given a chat application that can be configured to run as a server or as a client. We have changed program so all messages was sent encrypted and then decrypted at the recipient with a symetric key. Additionally we implemented a Diffie-Hellman key exchange for producing a common symetric key when the program is communicating directly with other clients (P2P).
